A simple music player

If you're having trouble running this in Intellij, simply do this:
On the top menu in Intellij go to "File" -> "Project Structure" -> "Modules" -> click the plus sign beneath "Module SDK" -> "JARs or Directories"
-> locate the "sqljdbc4.jar" file inside the "lib" directory -> click "Ok" -> "Apply" -> "Ok" and it should work now
